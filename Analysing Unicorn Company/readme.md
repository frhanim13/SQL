 Objective 
 
This project aims to analyze the creation of new unicorns across industries during the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. By identifying the best-performing industries and their key metrics, this analysis provides insights into the trends and valuations of unicorn startups.

Methodology

Identify Top-Performing Industries
We will determine the three best-performing industries based on the total number of new unicorns created during the combined period of 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Extract Key Metrics
For each of the identified industries, we will gather the following details:

Number of Unicorns: Total unicorns created in each year within the selected industries.

Year of Achievement: The specific year in which these companies achieved unicorn status.

Average Valuation: Calculate the average valuation of unicorns in each industry, converted to billions of dollars, rounded to two decimal places.

Output Results:
A final table will summarize the findings with the following columns:

Industry: The name of the industry.

Year: The year in which unicorns achieved their status.

Num_Unicorns: The number of new unicorns in that year.

Average_Valuation_Billions: The average valuation of these unicorns (in billions).

For better readability, the results will be sorted in descending order by Year and Num_Unicorns.


Deliverables

The analysis will return a structured table, ready for further interpretation and visualization, providing stakeholders with actionable insights into the top industries driving unicorn growth during the defined period.
